# Day 1

### Warmup
*Review:* [Pre-bootcamp exercise](https://jsbin.com/lekihiyiqe/1/edit?js,console)

### Terminal
*Exercise:*
1. Change to the Documents directory with `cd folder_name`
2. List out all of the files in that folder with `ls`
3. Create a new folder (`mkdir`) and `cd` to your new folder
4. Create a new file (`touch`)
6. Return to your home directory (~)
7. `cd` to your newly created folder using only 1 command
8. Delete the file you created in #4 (`rm`)

### Git & GitHub

*Exercise:*
Visit *[https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)* and complete exercises 1, 2, and 3

*Exercise:*
1. Clone this GitHub repository
2. Checkout a new branch called *your_name*
3. Use your IDE to change title of readme to *{your name}â€™s Bootcamp Overview*
4. Stage and commit your changes
5. Push your branch up to the remote

*Brainstorm:*
Can you think of ways to organize your git repositories and branches in order to facilitate collaboration over the summer? (For instance: do you each have a branch under your name? or do you create a new branch for every new feature?)

### Package/Dependency Management

1. What is npm and how does it work?
2. What are some examples of other package management tools?
3. What's the purpose of package.json? package-lock.json?
4. Why do you have a folder called node_modules?

*I would recommend trying to initialize npm in your cloned repository for practice*

### More Javascript

0. What is asynchronocity? Why is it important? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/748175/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-execution-what-does-it-really-mean

Note the differences between the following two examples:

**Synchronous**
```javascript
function getGoogle() {
  console.log("A");
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){ console.log(i);}      
  console.log("C");
}
```

**Asynchronous**
```javascript
function getGoogle() {
  console.log("A");
  fetch("google.com").then(function(res) {
    console.log("B: I got the website!");
  });
  console.log("C");
}
```

1. What is a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)? (+ [Using Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises))
2. What is Promise.all?
3. What is a callback?
4. How does `this` work in javascript?
5. What is an arrow function? What's different about arrow functions?
6. What is going on here?
   Can you rewrite with function() instead of => ?

```javascript
let addFiveDigits = a => b => c => d => e => a + b + c + d + e;
addFiveDigits(1)(1)(1)(1)(1);
```

7. What are object prototypes?
8. What are higher order components (HOCs)?

*If you want more practice with promises, here is a good resource: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/some-pratice*

#### Node.js
Take some time to read through this article and understand the concepts: [What is Node.js?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5)

### Release 1 (on your own)

In your local branch of this repository, complete the exercises in the [asyncExamples.js](https://github.com/asalexanderlee/bootcamp-1/blob/master/asyncExamples.js) file. To run your javascript, `cd` into your repository in terminal and run `node filename.js` (you can also write javascript directly in your terminal by typing `node` to start a session and `.exit` to exit). When you're finished, please commit your changes and push up your branch to the origin.
